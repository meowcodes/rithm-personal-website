    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <h3>I came across R in regression class during grad school. It was my first experience with programming and I found myself enjoying playing around with loops, helper functions, and data visualizations. Throughout the semester, I explored data analysis and visualization as the research analyst on a meta analysis project. I became interested the role of data visualization in bridging the gap between research and the public. During the summer of 2017, I taught myself foundational front-end web development. Following fall, I learned basic programming and algorithms in a C++ class. In April 2018, I was hired by a blockchain start-up to work on the front-end development of their existing website. I learned a lot by working on an active project until the start-up ran out of funding. I learned JavaScript through classes offered by local organizations such as Girl Develop it and Women Who Code. I participated in hackathons and collaborated with fellow programmers to develop minimum viable products for presentation. I committed to attending Rithm School’s full-stack developer bootcamp. In preparation, I worked on several personal projects and deepened my knowledge in foundations of computer science (CS50 and …). In January 2019, I will begin my curriculum at Rithm School.</h3>
